# Icebreaker Event
This python based icebreaker game displays three random (different) questions on a tkinter window when "Ques" button is pressed. The user can put these random questions to the players which are to be answered within a stipulated time. "Clear" button destroys the window.
This is a team-bonding, fun to play and participative game.
